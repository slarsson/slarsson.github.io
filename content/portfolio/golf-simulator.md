    Realistic simulation of a golf ball flight path. Implemented as a simple web browser game with JavaScript and three.js. 
---

Together with three other students we built a simple golf simulator as a project for the course *TNM085 - Modelling Project* at Link√∂ping University. A mathematical model for the flightpath was first implemented in MATLAB. The model was then used in the implementation of a simple web browser game.

The game was created with JavaScript and three.js and used a custom Webpack/Gulp development setup. Assets were created in Blender.
