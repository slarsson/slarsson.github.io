Bachelor project during my third year in the education *Master of Science in Media Technology and Engineering* at Link√∂ping University. The project was carried out together with five other students and the agile project management methodology Scrum were used.

During the project the group created a price comparison website with Next.js, an automated web scraping service in Python and an admin interface with React. I mainly worked on the web scraping and data collection part, database structure and built the admin interface.

Worked with: *TypeScript, Next.js, React, Python, asyncio, AIOHTTP, BeautifulSoup, Docker, MySQL, GitHub Actions*

Screenshots of the admin interface:
